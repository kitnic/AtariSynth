# AtariSynth

Simple Atari punk synth.

Example of what it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I34vxjkwVPY ( not identical to it )

Soldering should be pretty straighforward , it is designed for small enclosures so it would be ideal not to solder the pot to the board but take wires from the board to the pot pins.

It runs on a 9v battery.
